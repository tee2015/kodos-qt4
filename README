Kodos-Qt4
=========

What is Kodos?
--------------

Kodos is a regex text editor oriented toward Python, written by Phil Schwartz
using Python and PyQt3. You can find this original project at
http://kodos.sourceforge.net/

What is Kodos-Qt4?
------------------

"Kodos-Qt4", as it is currently named, is an effort to rewrite the original
software using the newest PyQt4 library. It aims to give the same level of
functionalities at the original version.

I'm an avid user of Kodos, and as it was the latest software on my computer
which was using Qt3, I thought it was a nice idea to give it a new life; also, I
wanted for a long time to give PyQt4 a try, so, here it is!

How to run Kodos-Qt4?
---------------------

If you want to give it a try, you can do the following::

    $ git clone git://github.com/multani/kodos-qt4
    $ cd kodos-qt4
    $ ./run-kodos

What is the status of Kodos-Qt4?
--------------------------------

This project is mostly in stand-by at the time of writing. The rewrite is not
complete, although it should be functional for the most important part, but
there are still quite a lot of things lacking.

There are alternative ports, like https://github.com/luksan/kodos which is a
direct port from Qt3 to Qt4 of the original code base.

If you feel like contributing to this project, feel free to send me pull
requests, patches, or antyhing else, I'll glady include them!
